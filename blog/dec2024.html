                After our first GBM, we held a new member social in the courtyard, featuring outdoor games like Frisbee,
                Spike Ball, and ring toss. Snacks and refreshments were provided, creating an opportunity for new
                members to connect. The event concluded with a Frisbee circle, where everyone shared their names and got

            <p>
                We held a volleyball match as the first installment in our ongoing intra-subteam competition, pitting
                the mechanical subteam against the electrical and computer subteams. After a hard-fought and intense
                game, the electrical and computer subteams emerged victorious. Having Brian and Winston on the same team
                was a scary combo, and even though they were throwing a bit, mechanical was throwing harder, costing
                them the win.
                Mehcniacal needs a lot of practice if they ever want to rival the compueter/electrical volleyball
                powerhouse.

                When Sabrina Carpenter's Sweet and Sour Tour came to Charlottesville for a sold-out show, MARS took the
                opportunity to run concessions. Leading up to the event, we prepped by memorizing the setlist, and
                during the show, we managed to sneak off occasionally to catch glimpses of the performance. Running the
                booth was a fun experience as we handled cashiers and managed the front-of-house food stands. To top it
                off, we even got to take home a giant tray of chicken tenders!

                In the spirit of Halloween, MARS hosted its now-annual pumpkin painting event, continuing our series of
                intra-subteam competitions. After the GBM, everyone gathered in the Lacy MARS room, picked out a
                pumpkin, and began painting their designs. Once finished, we voted on the best pumpkins. Mechanical took
                home the prize for best large pumpkin with Nayeon and Criag's Buc-ee's design, while Electrical won best
                small

            <p>
                Just before the Thanksgiving holiday, MARS hosted its own version of Friendsgiving—<i>Marsgiving! </i>
                This event is widely considered the favorite social gathering among MARS members. We kicked off the
                night by
                preparing a delicious Thanksgiving spread, including mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, stuffing, and
                warming up store-bought turkey. The evening was filled with shenanigans, including a cheap vs. expensive
                mac and cheese contest and trolling Craig until he cracked. We wrapped up the night with an epic karaoke
                session, singing our hearts out and blasting our favorite songs at full volume.

                To get into the holiday spirit, we held a gingerbread house-making contest. After the GBM, MARS members
                paired up and took on the challenge of assembling the best gingerbread house using a kit. This event was

                For our final concessions shift of the semester, we headed to John Paul Jones Arena to run concessions
                for the men's basketball game. It was a typical shift, but with the twist that the two MARS teams were
                stationed in competing stands on the 100-level section. This gave us a unique advantage with a monopoly,
                but also sparked a friendly competition to see who could sell the most. We ended the night with a
                massive haul of leftover concessions food, which Craig, Ben, Jordan, and Gabe seized the opportunity to
                create a glizzy tribute.
